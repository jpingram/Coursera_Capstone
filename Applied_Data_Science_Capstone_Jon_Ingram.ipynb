    "# **What is the best Tucson neighborhood for Embassy Tire to expand to next?**\n",
    "#### Authored by Jon Ingram\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Embassy Tire & Wheel Company is a growing, family-owned business in the Tucson Metro Area. Starting from a single location in 2004, it is now expanding to a third location set to open in the summer of 2019. The positioning of the three current locations provide a decent range of coverage of the region. As a growing business, they most certainly aren't planned to settle on just three locations. After the third location opens and business starts to pick up, the company is sure to look to expand once again. But where to?\n",
    "\n",
    "The report seeks to answer the question of \"given the population and tire shop distribution of the Tucson Metro Area, where would be the best neighborhood(s) to look to expand into?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data \n",
    "The types of data that are required to execute this idea are mostly population data and location data. Specifically, it requires data like the neighborhoods of Tucson, their populations, population densities, and the locations of all neighborhoods and tire shops in the Tucson metro area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for the populations and population densities of the top 50 populated neighborhoods in Tucson are publically available at the following Statistical Atlas website: https://statisticalatlas.com/place/Arizona/Tucson/Population. The neighborhood names of the 50 most populated neighborhoods, their populations, their rank in population, their population densities, and their rank in population densities will be ripped directly from the website. This will be accomplished using the Beautiful Soup library. \n",
    "\n",
    "The population data as well as the Statistical Atlas links for each neighborhood will be collected into a single DataFrame for ease of use. This DataFrame will also contain an Area (in square miles) column calculated by dividing Population (number of people) by Population Density (number of people per square mile) for each neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geographical locations of these neighborhoods will be retrieved using OpenStreetMap data obtained from the geocoder library. Locations which are not retrieved using this method will be found manually using the Google search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The acquisition of tire shop location data is a process in several steps. First, the zip codes of major postal area codes in Tucson will be taken manually from the following Statistical Atlas website: https://statisticalatlas.com/place/Arizona/Tucson/Overview. Their geographical coordinates do not appear in OpenStreetMap so their coordinates will be acquired manually using the Google Search engine. Finally, these locations will be used as the basis for a series of Foursquare API search queries (with keyword 'tire') to collect a comprehensive list of tire shops in the Tucson Metro Area. The IDs, Names, and Location in coordinates will be taken from the results of the queries and be compiled into a pandas DataFrame."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Of our top 10 neighborhoods, some of them have to be ruled out due to their proximity to the current three Embassy Tire & Wheel locations and other shops. For example, using the generated map as a reference, Amphi places 2nd overall as a very ideal candidate but is only about a mile away from the location at Prince. As a small, yet, growing business, opening a new shop a mile away from a current location is a poor idea. So, Amphi must be ruled out as a potential neighborhood for expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to note that just the population, population density and tire shop count alone may not be enough to give the best objective suggestion in selecting Tucson neighborhoods for expansion. Other factors may include Average Individual Income, Average Household Income, Household Types, and Industries in each area. This is just a non-comprehensive list of additional factors which are potentially important to look into but all of the data in that list, like the Population data, is also available on Statistical Atlas.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the brevity of the dataset in mind, an interesting observation is the proximity of some of the top ten neighborhoods to the locations at Prince and Valencia (the locations on the Western side of the city). The success of the Prince and Valencia locations is what has allowed the company to continue to expand. While these close neighborhoods (namely: Amphi, Campus Farm, and Elvira) need to be ruled out with regards to new expansions, the fact that such high ranking neighborhoods (which include neighborhoods ranked 2 and 3) are geographically close to already successful locations suggests that the current algorithm used to generate the list of top neighborhoods can imply future success in expansion into other top neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the generated map as a reference, it is determined that Cherry Avenue, Sunnyside, and Corbett are the ideal Tucson neighborhoods to look to expand into. Placed near the center of town, they all rank high statistically (ranked 1, 5, and 6, respectively) and are effectively equidistant from the current three Embassy Tire & Wheel locations. The map also indicates that the center of town is fairly lacking in tire shops in general which would also make this region great for expansion.\n",

    "For information on the location data, demographics and more on those neighborhoods, the links to their Statistical Atlas websites will be provided below.\n",
